# Guide for Contributors

We welcome all contributions to this repository, be those bug reports, fixes
or new features. However, we do ask that you read this guide before submitting
your contribution.

## Scope

This repository (`stripe_kit`) is a Python package meant to act as a toolkit
and a layer inbetween Isaac Lab and third party code. Thus, please avoid
contributing code that is beyond this scope. For example; avoid adding specific
environment generation code. However, if you did create a module utilising
`stripe_kit`, we will gladly link it so that other users may use it.

We encourage contributions that improve the toolkit's functionality or add new
features that enhance its usability. Particularly, of great concern for us
the breadth of the supported environment types. If you have an example of an
environment, that cannot be generated by the toolkit, please consider adding
it to the repository, or submit an issue.

## Code Guidelines

Please ensure that your code is properly formatted, ideally using a tool such
as [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/). Beyond that, we suggest you use
a linter, such as [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright). The
`pyproject.toml` contains configuration for these tools.

## Tests

Unfortunately, automated unit testing is not yet implemented. The difficulties
of working with Isaac Sim is the main cause, and we are working on a solution.
